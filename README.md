### Version >=3.8 of Python used when writing and testing.

## Description
The Simulated Annealing code is located in the **simulatedAnnealing.py** file,
while the code that parses the XML input files and generates a solution is
**parsexml.py**. Here a random initial solution is generated, simulated
annealing is run on it, and the cost of the initial solution as well as the new
one (if one was obtainable) is printed to the terminal.

## How to run
The input file has to be put into the same directory as the **parsexml.py**
file. The input file to be run on can be changed in the **parsexml.py** file at
the top. To run the code simply run parsexml.py with python by issuing the
command ``python parsexml.py''.
