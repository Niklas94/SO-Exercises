The Simulated Annealing code is located in the simulatedAnnealing.py file, while
the code that parses the XML input files and generates a solution is
parsexml.py. Here a random initial solution is generated, simulated annealing is
run on it, and the cost of the initial solution as well as the new one (if one
was obtainable) is printed to the terminal.

To run the code simply run parsexml.py with python by issuing the command
``python parsexml.py''.
